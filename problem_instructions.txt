The only useful folder is the "test" folder.

The problem is that, when setting up the environment by executing "./bootsrtap", it will give an error at the last step, i.e. "make".

The error is shown as the following:
Connecting to ftp.gnu.org (ftp.gnu.org)|::ffff:209.51.188.20|:21... connected.
Logging in as anonymous ... Logged in!
==> SYST ... done.    ==> PWD ... done.

Retrying.


To reproduce the problem, please do the following steps:
cd test
/bin/bash containerCreator.sh 1
docker start -ai testenv_1
./bootstrap
# Note that it usually takes 10-20min


The followings are the explainations of some files in "test" folder:

containerCreator.sh:
it will create a docker image using Modusfile named as "patch1:f1x-demo",
and then create a docker container using this image, the name of this container is "testenv_1"
To run it, please run "/bin/bash containerCreator.sh 1"

delContainer.sh:
it will delete the docker container and the image that are created above.
To run it, pleaser run "/bin/bash delContainer.sh 1"

Modusfile:
The pseudocode is like:
  from ubuntu:14.04
  apt install -y git wget
  copy ./f1x-genprog-icse12 to /
  
Modusfile_backup:
The old version of Modusfile.
